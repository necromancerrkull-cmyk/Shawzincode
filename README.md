A Small decryption program that I decided to use as my capstone after playing around with Buff000n's Shawzinscore and finding a patern with the song codes that inspired me to me an encryption method -https://buff0000n.github.io/shawzinscore 

I did use AI to clean it up so it's at least a bit more tangible since my code tends to be a bit messy but most of it is unchanged besides the size by a little bit and how it seperates each part of the program.
